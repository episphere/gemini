Additionally, and separately in the container is a tan-pink fimbriated fallopian tube (3.9 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm). The uterine fundus serosal surface is tan, smooth, markedly distorted, and disrupted in the anterior aspect. There are marked adhesions identified at the anterior and posterior aspects of the uterus. The ectocervix (3.4 x 3.3 cm) is tan-pink and slightly ragged. The specimen is bivalved to reveal an endocervical canal (3.9 cm in length) which is slightly hemorrhagic with herringbone architecture. The endometrial cavity (4.2 x 1.2 x 0.2 cm) is hemorrhagic and markedly distorted by a tan-white whorled nodule (5.6 x 4.9 x 4.0 cm) present at the fundus in the anterior aspect within tan-pink slightly trabeculated myometrium ranging from 2.2-3.2 cm in thickness. There is a transmural rupture (5.2 x 3.6 x 2.8 cm) identified at the anterior aspect of the uterus exposing the tan-white whorled nodule. Both anterior and posterior halves are serially sectioned to reveal the tan-white whorled nodule with white homogenous cut surfaces.
