Welcome to the CDM Survey Sub‐Working Group wiki!
Mission Statement
The CDM Survey Sub-Workgroup is a collaborative effort to unlock the potential of survey data within the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) framework. We aim to develop a standardized approach for integrating survey data into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). This will be achieved through the development of standards, tools, and best practices to transform survey questions and responses into the CDM format. This, in turn, will empower researchers to conduct more robust analyses across diverse datasets, ultimately leading to richer insights and improved health outcomes.

Discussion
* Introductions
   * Leila Orszag, post-baccalaureate fellow on Connect Analytics team
* Landscape Survey Content, continued
   * Question Ordering
      * Want to start with basic/easy to answer questions to avoid attrition early on
      * Rearrange to ask for links to code, survey itself before anything else as these likely provide important information for our purposes
      * Ask for contact information for follow up purposes at the end of the survey
      * Ask lifecycle question towards start of survey
   * Question Reworking
      * Institution Question
         * Reword to get the information we are actually looking for: who developed the tool and who administered the survey
         * Potentially add question about whether the study the survey was used for was single institution or a consortium
      * Modifications to Existing Tools Question
         * Narrow question and use drop down
         * New options: added/removed questions, added/removed responses, edited questions, edited responses, changed instructions, reordered, and none of the above
      * Reassessment
         * Add new question to ascertain whether reassessments are done at all
         * Allow for open text option since some surveys have specific/irregular reassessment cycles
      * Summary scores
         * Include explanation text in question to make sure people understand what we are asking
      * Data availability: clarify in question whether we are talking about individual or summary level data
         * Add option for controlled data access
      * Data storage
         * Is this important to know?
         * What if data is stored in multiple formats?
         * Should we ask about this in another survey targeted towards groups who are further along in the process?
* Landscape Survey Administration
   * Google Forms seems like a good option
      * Skip logic is available by section
   * Maybe survey should be sectioned
      * Basics: links, institution
      * Survey: language, administration, reassessment, data storage
      * Analysis: mapping of OMOP, tools, etc.
   * Group will test survey prior to us sending it out to others
To Dos
*  Send out drafted survey questions - Nicole
*  Review survey questions & return suggestions to Nicole - all, by end of next week
*  Create draft survey - Nicole & Leila

1. Transformation of the UK Biobank to the OMOP Common Data Model, Vaclav Papez
Discussion
* Transformation of the UK Biobank to the OMOP Common Data Model, Vaclav Papez:
   * Paper Link
   * Objective: Federated research related to COVID-19.
   * UK Biobank Description
      * Population level
      * Longitudinal research study of 500k patients ranging 40-69 years
      * Participants located across England, Scotland, Wales
   * Data Collection Types & Sources
      * Baseline phenotypic data
         * 8000 data fields, most of which uses proprietary dictionaries without mappings to other vocabularies
         * prioritized 500 data fields based on working group recommendations and clinician interest
         * 5 people within Papez's group worked on this project and they did outsource some of the work
         * implementation was smooth; code is publicly available on GitHub. However, much of the code is specific to UK Biobank so may not be easily reusable
      * Electronic health records (EHR) from primary care centers & hospitals
         * Imaging data
      * Cancer registry
      * National death registry
      * Genotypic data, including biomarkers
      * Sociodemographic & lifestyle data
      * Mapping details
         * Mapped numerical values to appropriate units
         * For Boolean variables, only mapped True responses to a concept ID. Ignored false values
         * For discrete fields, mapped to concept & value
         * Mapped dates & demographic details directly to OMOP CDM
         * Tested mapping using synthetic data
         * Did not achieve full coverage, but stopped mapping at a sufficient level (as determined by their team) as further mapping would have been very resource intensive
   * Current Challenges
      * Wide format of baseline data
      * Proprietary baseline data codings
      * Diverse coding systems for EHR
      * Diverse recording practice from different regional data providers
      * No existing mappings for some vocabularies
   * Survey Data Experience & Mapping Methods
      * Numeric fields: concept & event mapping, unit mapping
      * Boolean fields: concept mapping
      * Discrete fields: concept mapping, value mapping
      * Had to create bespoke mapping for continuous, discrete, unit data types
      * Baseline data processing – syntactic mapping
         * Source to stem_table to CDM
         * Wide to long format
      * Data fields annotated by OMOP Concept ID using the UK biobank Athena vocabulary
         * No mapping from nonstandard UK Biobank fields to standard SNOMED concepts to custom mapping tables (USAGI)
         * All semantically unmapped fields were transformed into the OMOP Observation domain with a Concept ID ‘0’ and the original field ID as the source value
   * Results of Baseline Mapping
      * Not a lot of coverage for mapped used terms but a lot of coverage for mapped events
   * Challenges of Questionnaire Data in the CDM
      * Significant amount of preprocessing and consolidation across multiple fields
         * Many vocabularies and mapping tables
         * Each type of data required different mapping approaches
         * Insufficient number of OMOP measurement attributes
         * Explicitly captured negation and data missingness
         * Historical medical events are considered outside the observation period
   * Questions
      * Code for transformation is available on GitHub; however, much of the work is not generalizable because it was developed specifically for UK Biobank
      * If given the chance to do this again, Papez would use an automatic or semi-automatic pipeline for validation
      * If participant responses to the same question change over time, Papez would use most recent answer if it made logical sense

1. Entity Attribute Value Model Data in Handling OMOP CDM, Oleg Zhuk
2. Landscape Survey, continued (Past Discussion)
Discussion
* Entity Attribute Value Model Data in Handling OMOP CDM, Oleg Zhuk:
   * Issues
      * Survey vocabularies are heterogenous in structure and standard OMOP codes are often misused
      * There is only one concept representing each clinical event, but sometimes people want to ask closely related but sufficiently different questions for this to be effective.
      * There should be no negative information. No concept should represent the absence of evidence
      * No timing should be present in vocabularies. To get/analyze time information, queries should be run
      * Sometimes questions are same, but answer choices are different. This also creates significant issues with mapping.
   * Recommendations
      * Make question specific changes
      * Add one field (value_source_concept_id) into two tables (observation & measurement)
      * Align definition of the CDM fields with the mapping practice & expectations
   * Questions & Discussion
      * Benefits & logic of mapping to non-standard vs. working within standard concepts
         * Standard concepts violate the vocabulary principe of "unique standard concepts"
      * Examples of standard vs. non-standard concepts
         * Most drugs are standard
         * Zhuk stated he only creates meaningful standard concepts, meaning he does not create standard concepts for every non-standard concept. Not every concept is meant to be standardized because some vary meaningfully from survey to survey; wants to allow those running those individual surveys to create their own (non-standard) concepts.
      * Vocabulary should deal with matching survey data to EHR data. Zhuk states some custom logic could be created to deal with this issue.
* Landscape Survey, continued: (Past Discussion)
